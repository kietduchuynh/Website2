Why is it so difficult to make a correlation matrix? Especially ones typically seen in journal articles (that includes astericks to indicate significant correlations). For this post, I hope to simplify the process.

```{r}
# Load package
library(psychTools)
library(dplyr)

# see psychology datasets in the psychTools package
data(package='psychTools')
data <- affect

# Describe variables
psych::describe.by(data)

# Filter data to include only relevant variables
data2 <- data %>% select(ext, neur, imp, PA1, NA1, BDI)

# Estimate correlations
GGally::ggpairs(data2, title="correlogram with ggpairs()") 
```

## [ ] Use apaTables package to create APA style correlation table and regression table
Maybe you can import the table from the pdf output into the R file.
